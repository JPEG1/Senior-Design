## Appendix

#### Note:
*Adding full documentation for all of the resources/references utilized this semester would be nearly impossible. I have however, added a concise list with a few links that should cover most of the topics covered, as well as some open-source libraries referenced or utilized during development. Lastly, I've added a brief description of some collaborative work that I helped manage, where my project was used to aid development of an iOS equivalent architecture.*

### iOS Architecture
My project is a templated Android app architecture, as this report has outlined in detail. However, an iOS equivalent needed to be developed in order to cover our iOS customer base & product line. Thus, using the architecture I've designed as a *master* design, Performance Electronics (PE) Ltd. contracted out development of such a system to another company. I've served as a primary correspondent in case questions arise during development. I've also been invited to join in sprint planning & design review meetings to ensure progress continues, following the architecture I've defined here in Android. A significant portion of time has been dedicated to this entire process.
