# Project Abstract
My project is a Templated Mobile Application Architecture, specifically for Android. At my co-op employer, Performance Electronics, creating new mobile apps was a costly & inefficient process. This project revolutionized the Android app development process by providing a modular, templated structure from which new apps can be created, shortening development time for new apps by upwards of 80%!
