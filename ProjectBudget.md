## Project Budget
*There weren't any outwrite expenses that were necessary for the project. However, we could do an estimated engineering cost based on development hours.*

* Started on June 1, 2024 with 40hr work weeks until late August (3 months).
* At $23/hr, that runs around $920/wk or $3680/month. So full-time development costs total approximately **$11040** over the summer.
* Once classes resumed, I transitioned to part-time (MWF) work, so my hours were cut to around 24/wk. Development is expected to continue until next April/May, so we can roughly estimate the total part-time development costs.
* With 24hr work weeks, it costs around $2208/month for development. Continuing until the end of April puts a total part-time development costs at roughly **$17664**.
* Thus, an estimated total development cost for the project based on a $23/hr part-time rate would be **$28704**.
